# CliffEBM
A Gridded Ice Cliff Energy Balance Model

This repository provides a model code that calculates the distributed surface energy balance for ice cliffs, i.e. steep ice surfaces with complex, heterogeneous topographies. It was originally designed for supraglacial ice cliffs on debris-covered glaciers.
The model has been applied on debris-covered glaciers in the Nepalese Himalayas (Buri et al., 2016a) and in Southeast Tibet (Kneib et al., 2022).


Here we provide example input data (digital elevation models, shapefiles, meteodata) to run the CliffEBM on one supraglacial cliff on the debris-covered Lirung Glacier (Nepal).
To run the model you need to download the entire branch on your machine, and adjust the paths in the model code (CliffEBM.R) according to the paths on your machine.
